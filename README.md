# Explore building violations in Houston

In this project, I explored a dataset about building violations in Houston publicly available in the Open Data page of the City of Houston ([link](https://data.houstontx.gov/dataset/city-of-houston-building-code-enforcement-violations-don)). This project is associated with the Data Science Certification I completed at the Data Incubator ([Pragmatic Institue](https://www.credly.com/badges/f789cc0f-a7fc-4c04-adaf-8b72ca5f421c)).

Using R data frames, I performed multiple operations to explore the data and extract insights, coupling this with coordinate data of the different locations to also perform spacial anlyses. The corresponding [script](scripts/challenge_1.R) can be found in the ```scripts``` folder along with the outputs ([.Rout file](scripts/challenge_1.Rout) and [plots in PDF](scripts/Rplots.pdf)).
